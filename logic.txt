PLAN:
interface: 
1. a webpage with a (default) 16 x 16 grid that gets colored on hover ✔
2. a button at the top to change the size, that creates a
new grid in the original space ✔

inputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. mouse hover over the divs
2. div (grid square) changing color (by changing
background color using javascript)

(TO CHANGE GRID SIZE)
1. mouse click on new grid with new size button
2. enter new number of squares per side inside PROMPT (max 64 x 64)
3. mouse click to confirm new rows and columns (if no input, do nothing)


outputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. the divs getting colored in black (default)

(FOR NEW GRID)
1. new grid (in the same space where the default grid was) 

Divide & Conquer.


New Grid button:
- interface: 
1. button

-input: 
1. click event

-output: 
1. a prompt to enter new number of squares in rows: link this number to rows
2. a prompt to enter new number of squares in columns: link this number to columns
3. a new grid of n-size (max 64 x 64) that gets coloured just like the default IN the same space as the dafault
