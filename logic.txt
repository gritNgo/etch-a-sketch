PLAN:
interface: 
1. a webpage with a (default) 16 x 16 grid
2. a button at the top to change the size, that clears and gives 
new grid in the same total space as before 

inputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. mouse hover over the divs(mouse enter?)
2. div (grid square) changing color (by adding new class/changing
background color using javascript?)
3. mouse leaving the div (mouse leave?)

(TO CHANGE GRID SIZE)
1. mouse click on new grid with new size button
2. mouse click to confirm new width x height inside prompt


outputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. the divs getting colored in black (default)

(FOR NEW GRID)
1. prompt to enter the new width for the new grid size (max 64 x 64)
2. prompt to enter the new height for the new grid size (max 64 x 64)
3. new grid (in the same space where the default grid was) 


Divide & Conquer.
