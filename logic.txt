PLAN:
interface: 
1. a (default) 16 x 16 grid
2. a button at the top to change the size, that clears and gives 
new grid in the same total space as before 

inputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. mouse hover over the divs
2. mouse click on the divs (mouse down, mouse press?)
3. mouse leaving the div

(TO CHANGE GRID SIZE)
1. mouse click on change size button (prompt or textbox?)
2. enter new size (max 64 x 64)
3. mouse click to confirm new width x height 

outputs: 
(TO COLOR)
1. the divs getting colored in black (default) -> later, in random RGBs
(on new size)

(TO CHANGE GRID SIZE)
1. clear current grid?
2. new grid of entered size (within the same space main 
div container as the default grid)
